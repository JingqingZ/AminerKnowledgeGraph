AMiner KnowledgeGraph 
======

## Introduction  
Use scientific network data from AMiner to generate a knowledge graph of
 different research fields, trying to get the time evolution of different research area   

## Directories
src/ contains all the source files   
results/ contains the result generated by our algorithm   
data/ contains the original data from AMiner

## Usage
You can use knowledge_graph.py to generate the result, or use the following codes:  
1. use fetch_data.py to get data from AMiner  
2. use parse_publication_tag.py to get keywords  
3. use parse_publication_time_author.py to get the simplified version of publication  
4. use merge_keywords.py to get the keywords after merge  
5. use time_keyword_distribution.py to get the time distribution of each topic  
6. use algorithm1.py to get the correlation and evolution
